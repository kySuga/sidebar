After realizing I had created an accessible "sidebar" (aka - side sheet) previously on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/kySuga/pen/vYdmXZv), I ported over what I had built out there to here. 
I did not make any updates, but there are some to be made, like refactoring the JS for example. For now, I will save that for another day... *onward*
